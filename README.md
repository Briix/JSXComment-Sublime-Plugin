JSX Comment plugin for Sublime Text
===================================
This very very simple plugin adds JSX comment functionality for Sublime Text through a custom keyboard shortcut.


Installation
------------
The plugin must be installed into the User folder.

On OS X this can be done with:

    cd ~/"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User"
    git clone https://github.com/Briix/JSXComment-Sublime-Plugin.git JSXComment


and on Windows with:

    cd "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User"
    git clone https://github.com/Briix/JSXComment-Sublime-Plugin.git JSXComment


Keyboard Shortcut
-----------------
This plugin features, as of now, a single shortcut that will wrap a block or line with `{/* */}`

|Feature    | Shortcut    |
|-----------|-------------|
|Comment    | `^ Shift C` |

Future Features
---------------
This plugin is very simple for now, but hopefully support for using the global Comment shortcut will be implemented #soon
